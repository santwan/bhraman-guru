/*
This small but powerful file does one simple thing: it tells your entire development environment (including your IDE's IntelliSense and ESLint) to recognize the @ alias.

"baseUrl": "src" sets the root for your imports to the src folder.
"paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] } maps the @/ prefix to the src/ directory.
You can now refactor your existing import statements to be much cleaner.
